I utilized: 
ros2 action send_goal /turtle1/rotate_absolute turtlesim/action/RotateAbsolute “{theta: x}”
to rotate the turtle to: 0 degrees, 90 degrees, 180 degrees, and 270 degrees
In theta, it was approximated to be 0, 1.55, 3.14, 4.69
In order to draw the line, I just used the teleop key to move the turtle forward one unit length.
