To change the pen to be black I used the set pen service:
ros2 service call /turtle1/set_pen turtlesim/srv/SetPen "{r: 0, g: 0, b: 0, width: 3}"

For drawing, I utilized: 
ros2 action send_goal /turtle1/rotate_absolute turtlesim/action/RotateAbsolute “{theta: x}”

to rotate the turtle to: 0 degrees, 90 degrees, 180 degrees, and 270 degrees
In theta, it was approximated to be 0, 1.55, 3.14, 4.69.
In order to draw the line, I just used the teleop key to move the turtle forward one unit length.
