## How 2 push stuff to github
```sh
git add --all
```
you can also run ```git add <file>``` but you're probably going to add everything anyway
```sh
git commit -m "<added a file>"
```
replace the message in quotes with whatever you want
```sh
git push
```
this pushes to the default branch. You can make other branches if you really want.
