## How 2 push stuff to github
```sh
git add --all
```
you can also run ```git add <file>``` but you're probably going to add everything anyway
```sh
git commit -m "<added a file>"
```
replace the message in quotes with whatever you want
```sh
git push
```
this pushes to the default branch. You can make other branches if you really want.

### if it gives you shit about your current branch being behind:

- run ```git pull```
- in the text editor arrow down below the lines that start with #
- write a message (it doesn't really matter what but you have to write something)
- ctrl+x
- press enter
- run git push again
